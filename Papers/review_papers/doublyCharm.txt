3: doesn't test QCD. Maybe, effective theories

39: this is not a sentence

footnote on pg. 1: remove 'particle/'

82: it's not quite the same because the decay is fully reconstructed in the reference, or if it is, mention that "this has also been found optimal for the partially reconstructed mode"

101: ' signal and control' -> 'the signal and the control'

Fig. 2: are the 3 bins to the left and 2 to the right of the Xi_c peak (red) in the TOS trigger category understood? - might just be a fluctuation, but it looks suspicious and might incdicate an under-estimation of the signal/overestimation of the background. Did you check that?

Fig. 2: 'with fit results overlaid' -> 'with results of the fit overlaid'

121: 'related to each other by the relative efficiency', could be clearer. Suggest to just write out exactly what is meant here (i.e. TOS/TIS)

Are the yield ratios (e.g. equation 3) fit parameters?

128: 'measure efficiencies' -> 'evaluate efficiencies'

154: 'generated phase space' -> 'generated according to phase space'

Table 1: reapeated 32, is this a copy-and-paste error or real?

182: kinematic correction is too vague. Correction of what?

189: 'cancel out' -> 'cancel'

207: 'by any of the theoretical predictions' -> 'by any of the theoretical predictions'





 




















General comments:

Why not include absolute branching fraction as well? 

Consistency: control modes -> normalisation modes 
Consistency: inner W-emisson -> internal W-emission
